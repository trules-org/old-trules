Something happens...  
In response, something is done...  
How did you know that something happened?  
What should you do in response?  

"Something happens" is an **Event**. Events happen. Events occur at points in time.  
  
"something is done" is an **Action**. Actions start at a point in time and end at a point in time.

"How did you know that something happened?" is **Event Detection**. Detection comes in two flavors - You are either **notified** that an event occured or you **recognize** that an event occured. Notification puts the onus on someone else to send the notification. Recognition puts the onus on you to spot the event - to recognize state changes and characteristics of the state that indicate the event has occured. Rules that evaluate the state are used to detect the occurence of events.  

"What should you do in response?" is **Event Handling**. Actions are performed when Events are detected. Rules that evaluate the state are used to determine what to do in response to an event.
